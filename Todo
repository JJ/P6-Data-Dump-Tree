roles to sub dump

filters on generic containers
scoped filter and roles

Requirements:

user interaction layer
	cache
		to avoid re-generating the data
	
	representation in
		Prima, curses, gtk, dhtml


dumper
	options
		#max depth, ...

	name
		allow dumper to be switched on and off by name at higher level
		eg: a piece of code contains a dumper but the user wants to control
			in which scope the dump should be done		

	handles multiple iterators
		synchronized glyphs (diff)

	returns one or multiple "row representations"
		multiple rows have synchronization points

	start and end tag per level
		ease generation of HTML for example

	#user defined filters

	dumps can be gathered from multiple source dynamically
		when getting to a specific point, data is gathered from another source
		no need to create a data structure in advance

	dump, gather, dump_gathered, reset interface.

	dumper can re-synchronize the glyphs
		if a stream ends, the glyph for the previous element
		may need to be changed	

	supports threads

	lazy row represention element generation

	can modify a previous glyph if the level after it is not the expected one
		ie, an element becomes the latest in the level

	when dumping multiple structures simulteanously
		diff color
		diff column
		diff glyphs

row representation
	can contain multiple fields for each data element dumped
		level, #data, #type, #inheritence, size, taint, tie, weak references, ...
	
	#user registrable representation generators
	class defined generator
		it can use this module and the glyphs get aligned properly

	colorizer
		per level
		per type

	lazy represention generation

	},

data iterator
	from data structure
	from feeder
		ie data can come from a stream


glyph generator
	option for different glyph representations

	generate a glyph based on a hierarchical level
		methode, input level, input glyphs, output a string
